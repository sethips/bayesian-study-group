## Bayesian Statistics
- [Ben Lambert's Bayesian Statistics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwJRxp3blEvZ8AKMXOy0fc0cqT61GsKCG): This course aims to provide a core understanding of Bayesian statistics  that is grounded in mathematical theory, yet friendly to the less mathematically-minded of persons. It aims to focus on the intuitive results of Bayesian theory rather than dwell on the mathematical minutiae.
  - [ben-lambert.com/bayesian](https://ben-lambert.com/bayesian/): "If you don’t know, Bayesian statistics is an analytical framework increasingly used in research in the social, physical and biological sciences. Specifically Bayesian statistics uses the language of probability to express our uncertainty about scientific hypotheses. A ‘hypothesis’ is an explanation about the state of the world that may be true or false; to ensure that a hypothesis is ‘scientific’ it must be testable with data. Accordingly, Bayesian statistics uses data we collect from the world to update our view on scientific hypotheses."
